abstract: 'Background: Chronic neck pain affects 50% - 85% of people who have experienced
  an acute episode. This transition and the persistence of chronic complaints are
  believed to be mediated by brain alterations among different central mechanisms.  Objectives:
  This study aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the current existing
  evidence regarding structural and functional brain alterations in patients with
  whiplash associated disorders (WAD) and idiopathic neck pain (INP). Additionally,
  associations between brain alterations and clinical symptoms reported in neck pain
  patients were evaluated.  Study Design: Systematic review.  Methods: The present
  systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Web
  of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched. First, the obtained articles were
  screened based on title and abstract. Secondly, the screening was based on the full
  text. Risk of bias in included studies was investigated.  Results: Twelve studies
  met the inclusion criteria. Alterations in brain morphology and function, including
  perfusion, neurotransmission, and blood oxygenation level dependent-signal, were
  demonstrated in chronic neck pain patients. There is some to moderate evidence for
  both structural and functional brain alterations in patients with chronic neck pain.
  In contrast, no evidence for structural brain alterations in acute neck pain patients
  was found.  Limitations: Only 12 articles were included, which allows only cautious
  conclusions to be drawn.  Conclusion: Brain alterations were observed in both patients
  with chronic WAD and chronic INP. Furthermore, more evidence exists for brain alterations
  in chronic WAD, and different underlying mechanisms might be present in both pathologies.
  In addition, pain and disability were correlated with the observed brain alterations.
  Accordingly, morphological and functional brain alterations should be further investigated
  in patients with chronic WAD and chronic INP with newer and more sensitive techniques,
  and associative clinical measurements seem indispensable in future research.'
