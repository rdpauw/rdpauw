abstract: 'Background: The spread of COVID-19 has affected people’s daily lives, and
  the lockdown may have led to a disruption of daily activities and a decrease of
  people’s mental health. Aim: To identify correlates of adults’ mental health during
  the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium and to assess the role of meaningful activities
  in particular. Methods: A cross-sectional web survey for assessing mental health
  (General Health Questionnaire), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), meaning
  in activities (Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey), and demographics was
  conducted during the first Belgian lockdown between April 24 and May 4, 2020. The
  lockdown consisted of closing schools, non-essential shops, and recreational settings,
  employees worked from home or were technically unemployed, and it was forbidden
  to undertake social activities. Every adult who had access to the internet and lived
  in Belgium could participate in the survey; respondents were recruited online through
  social media and e-mails. Hierarchical linear regression was used to identify key
  correlates. Results: Participants (N = 1781) reported low mental health (M = 14.85/36).
  In total, 42.4% of the variance in mental health could be explained by variables
  such as gender, having children, living space, marital status, health condition,
  and resilience (β = −.33). Loss of meaningful activities was strongly related to
  mental health (β = −.36) and explained 9% incremental variance (R2 change = .092,
  p < .001) above control variables. Conclusions: The extent of performing meaningful
  activities during the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium was positively related to adults’
  mental health. Insights from this study can be taken into account during future
  lockdown measures in case of pandemics.'
