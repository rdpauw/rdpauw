abstract: 'Background: Patients with chronic whiplash-associated disorders (CWAD)
  are characterized by pain of traumatic origin, cognitive deficits, and central sensitization
  (CS). Previous neuroimaging studies revealed altered grey matter volume (GMV) in
  mild traumatic brain injury patients and chronic pain conditions also characterized
  by CS. It can therefore be hypothesized that GMV alterations also play a role in
  the persistent complaints of CWAD. However, brain alterations remain poorly investigated
  in these patients.  Objectives: This study examined regional GMV alterations in
  patients with CWAD compared to patients with non-traumatic chronic idiopathic neck
  pain (CINP), who normally do not show CS at a group level, and healthy controls.
  Additionally, in both patient groups, relationships between regional GMV and measures
  of cognition as well as pain processing were assessed.  Study Design: A cross-sectional
  case-control study.  Setting: This study was performed at the Department of Rehabilitation
  Sciences and Physiotherapy of Ghent University in cooperation with the Ghent Institute
  for Functional and Metabolic Imaging.  Methods: Ninety-three women (28 healthy controls,
  34 CINP patients, and 31 CWAD patients) were enrolled. First, T1-weighted magnetic
  resonance images (MRIs) were acquired to examine GMV alterations in the brain regions
  involved in processing cognition and pain. Next, cognitive performance, pain cognitions,
  and CS symptoms were assessed. Finally, hyperalgesia and conditioned pain modulation
  efficacy were examined.  Results: Regional GMV of the right lateral orbitofrontal
  cortex, left supramarginal cortex, and left posterior cingulate cortex was decreased
  in CWAD patients compared to healthy controls (P = 0.023; P = 0.012; P = 0.047,
  respectively). Additionally, GMV of the right superior parietal cortex and left
  posterior cingulate cortex was decreased in CWAD patients compared to CINP patients
  (P = 0.008; P = 0.035, respectively). Decreased regional GMV correlated with worse
  cognitive performance, higher maladapted pain cognitions, CS symptoms, and hyperalgesia
  in CWAD patients (r(s) = -0.515 to -0.657; P < 0.01). In CINP patients, decreased
  regional GMV correlated only with worse cognitive performance (r(s) = -0.499 to
  -0.619; P < 0.01), and no GMV differences compared with the controls could be revealed.  Limitations:
  No conclusions about the causality of the observed relationships can be drawn.  Conclusions:
  These results provide the first evidence for reduced GMV in cortical regions involved
  in processing cognition and pain in patients with CWAD. Accordingly, it is recommended
  that therapy approaches for CWAD patients should address the brain and take into
  account neuroplasticity of the central nervous system (CNS).'
