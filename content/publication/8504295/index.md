abstract: "Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is characterized by maladaptive\
  \ central neuroplastic changes. Many observational studies have demonstrated that\
  \ chronic pain states are associated with brain alterations regarding structure\
  \ and/or function. Rehabilitation of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain\
  \ may include cognitive, exercise, or multimodal therapies.  Objective: The current\
  \ review aims to provide a constructive overview of the existing literature reporting\
  \ neural correlates, based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques,\
  \ following conservative treatment in chronic musculoskeletal pain patients.  Study\
  \ Design: Systematic review of the literature.  Methods: The current review was\
  \ conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and\
  \ Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Literature was searched from 3 databases and\
  \ screened for eligibility. Methodological quality across studies was assessed with\
  \ Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and quality of evidence\
  \ was determined applying the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development\
  \ and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.  Results: A total of 9 eligible studies were\
  \ identified with a predominant high risk of bias. Cognitive behavioral therapy\
  \ induced several structural and functional changes predominantly in prefrontal\
  \ cortical regions and a shift from affective to sensory-discriminative brain activity\
  \ after behavioral extinction training. Multidisciplinary treatment in pediatric\
  \ complex regional pain syndrome facilitated normalization of functional connectivity\
  \ of resting-state networks and the amygdala, and increased gray matter in prefrontal\
  \ and specific subcortical areas. Exercise therapy led to specific for resting-state\
  \ functional connectivity and a trend towards pressure-induced brain activity changes.\
  \  Limitations: A very small number of studies was available, which furthermore\
  \ exhibited small study samples. Moreover, only 2 of the included studies were randomized\
  \ controlled trials.  Conclusions: It is likely that conservative treatments may\
  \ induce mainly functional and structural brain changes in prefrontal regions in\
  \ patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Due to the relatively high risk of\
  \ bias across the included studies, future studies with randomized designs are needed\
  \ to confirm the current findings. In addition, more research evaluating."
