summary: The purpose of the COVIMPACT project is to set up a cohort of people who have been tested positive with COVID-19 in order to study the evolution of their physical, mental and social health over the long term, and assess the factors associated with a favourable or unfavourable evolution. Depending on when participants join the cohort, they are followed-up from a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of 2 years. In a nutshell, COVIMPACT aims to increase knowledge about the long-term effects of a COVID-19 infection and on the syndrome called "long COVID".
