Aim: To identify correlates of adults’ mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium and to assess the role of meaningful activities in particular. Methods: A cross-sectional web survey for assessing mental health (General Health Questionnaire), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), meaning in activities (Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey), and demographics was conducted during the first Belgian lockdown between April 24 and May 4, 2020. The lockdown consisted of closing schools, non-essential shops, and recreational settings, employees worked from home or were technically unemployed, and it was forbidden to undertake social activities. Every adult who had access to the internet and lived in Belgium could participate in the survey; respondents were recruited online through social media and e-mails. Hierarchical linear regression was used to identify key correlates. Results: Participants (N = 1781) reported low mental health (M = 14.85/36). In total, 42.4% of the variance in mental health could be explained by variables such as gender, having children, living space, marital status, health condition, and resilience (β = −.33). Loss of meaningful activities was strongly related to mental health (β = −.36) and explained 9% incremental variance (R2 change = .092, p ","tags":["\"Public Health\"","\"Environmental and Occupational Health\""],"title":"Meaningful activities during COVID-19 lockdown and association with mental health in Belgian adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Silvio Taccone","Nina Van Goethem","Robby De Pauw","Xavier Wittebole","Koen Blot","Herman Van Oyen","Tinne Lernout","Marion Montourcy","Geert Meyfroidt","Dominique Van Beckhoven"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620929802,"objectID":"910654ca974703e0e92fdef5e2147957","permalink":"https://brave-chandrasekhar-719c31.netlify.app/publication/taccone-2021-role/","publishdate":"2021-10-17T21:50:05.565908Z","relpermalink":"/publication/taccone-2021-role/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The role of organizational characteristics on the outcome of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU in Belgium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eveline VL","Cagnie B","Coppieters I","Meeus M","De Pauw R"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620929802,"objectID":"431c24c2d22b3209d40127145412b602","permalink":"https://brave-chandrasekhar-719c31.netlify.app/publication/pmid-33290364/","publishdate":"2021-10-17T21:50:05.693194Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pmid-33290364/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Changes in Muscle Morphology in Female Chronic Neck Pain Patients Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Previous neuroimaging studies revealed altered grey matter volume (GMV) in mild traumatic brain injury patients and chronic pain conditions also characterized by CS. It can therefore be hypothesized that GMV alterations also play a role in the persistent complaints of CWAD. However, brain alterations remain poorly investigated in these patients. Objectives: This study examined regional GMV alterations in patients with CWAD compared to patients with non-traumatic chronic idiopathic neck pain (CINP), who normally do not show CS at a group level, and healthy controls. Additionally, in both patient groups, relationships between regional GMV and measures of cognition as well as pain processing were assessed. Study Design: A cross-sectional case-control study. Setting: This study was performed at the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy of Ghent University in cooperation with the Ghent Institute for Functional and Metabolic Imaging. Methods: Ninety-three women (28 healthy controls, 34 CINP patients, and 31 CWAD patients) were enrolled. First, T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were acquired to examine GMV alterations in the brain regions involved in processing cognition and pain. Next, cognitive performance, pain cognitions, and CS symptoms were assessed. Finally, hyperalgesia and conditioned pain modulation efficacy were examined. Results: Regional GMV of the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, left supramarginal cortex, and left posterior cingulate cortex was decreased in CWAD patients compared to healthy controls (P = 0.023; P = 0.012; P = 0.047, respectively). Additionally, GMV of the right superior parietal cortex and left posterior cingulate cortex was decreased in CWAD patients compared to CINP patients (P = 0.008; P = 0.035, respectively). Decreased regional GMV correlated with worse cognitive performance, higher maladapted pain cognitions, CS symptoms, and hyperalgesia in CWAD patients (r(s) = -0.515 to -0.657; P ","tags":["\"Whiplash injuries\"","\"neck pain\"","\"magnetic resonance imaging\"","\"grey matter\"","\"cognitive dysfunction\"","\"pain catastrophizing\"","\"central sensitization\"","\"TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY\"","\"CENTRAL SENSITIZATION INVENTORY\"","\"CHRONIC-FATIGUE-SYNDROME\"","\"NECK-DISABILITY-INDEX\"","\"HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX\"","\"ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX\"","\"MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES\"","\"CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN\"","\"QUALITY-OF-LIFE\"","\"LOW-BACK-PAIN\""],"title":"Decreased regional grey matter volume in women with chronic whiplash-associated disorders : relationships with cognitive deficits and disturbed pain processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iris Coppieters","Robby De Pauw","Karen Caeyenberghs","Lieven Danneels","Jeroen Kregel","Astrid Pattyn","Mira Meeus","Barbara Cagnie"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620929806,"objectID":"577e9aaf66de8db30dd0e9b7eed37909","permalink":"https://brave-chandrasekhar-719c31.netlify.app/publication/coppieters-2017-decreased/","publishdate":"2021-10-17T21:50:08.889621Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coppieters-2017-decreased/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Decreased regional grey matter volume in women with chronic whiplash-associated disorders: relationships with cognitive deficits and disturbed pain processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iris Coppieters","Robby De Pauw","Jeroen Kregel","Anneleen Malfliet","Dorien Goubert","Dorine Lenoir","Barbara Cagnie","Mira Meeus"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620929806,"objectID":"825f7a7300645b94f727128bc8a3455f","permalink":"https://brave-chandrasekhar-719c31.netlify.app/publication/coppieters-2017-differences/","publishdate":"2021-10-17T21:50:09.14378Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coppieters-2017-differences/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Differences between women with traumatic and idiopathic chronic neck pain and women without neck pain: interrelationships among disability, cognitive deficits, and central sensitization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeroen Kregel","Iris Coppieters","Robby De Pauw","Anneleen Malfliet","Lieven Danneels","Jo Nijs","Barbara Cagnie","Mira Meeus"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620929806,"objectID":"124cd53ebece69f38bd3ee0713e5152d","permalink":"https://brave-chandrasekhar-719c31.netlify.app/publication/8504295/","publishdate":"2021-10-17T21:50:09.280011Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8504295/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is characterized by maladaptive central neuroplastic changes. Many observational studies have demonstrated that chronic pain states are associated with brain alterations regarding structure and/or function. Rehabilitation of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain may include cognitive, exercise, or multimodal therapies.  Objective: The current review aims to provide a constructive overview of the existing literature reporting neural correlates, based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, following conservative treatment in chronic musculoskeletal pain patients.  Study Design: Systematic review of the literature.  Methods: The current review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Literature was searched from 3 databases and screened for eligibility. Methodological quality across studies was assessed with Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and quality of evidence was determined applying the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.  Results: A total of 9 eligible studies were identified with a predominant high risk of bias. Cognitive behavioral therapy induced several structural and functional changes predominantly in prefrontal cortical regions and a shift from affective to sensory-discriminative brain activity after behavioral extinction training. Multidisciplinary treatment in pediatric complex regional pain syndrome facilitated normalization of functional connectivity of resting-state networks and the amygdala, and increased gray matter in prefrontal and specific subcortical areas. Exercise therapy led to specific for resting-state functional connectivity and a trend towards pressure-induced brain activity changes.  Limitations: A very small number of studies was available, which furthermore exhibited small study samples. Moreover, only 2 of the included studies were randomized controlled trials.  Conclusions: It is likely that conservative treatments may induce mainly functional and structural brain changes in prefrontal regions in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Due to the relatively high risk of bias across the included studies, future studies with randomized designs are needed to confirm the current findings. In addition, more research evaluating.","tags":["\"Chronic pain\"","\"musculoskeletal pain\"","\"MRI\"","\"functional MRI\"","\"therapy\"","\"rehabilitation\"","\"cognitive behavioral therapy\"","\"exercise therapy\"","\"COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY\"","\"CHRONIC BACK-PAIN\"","\"STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY\"","\"RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL\"","\"GRAY-MATTER\"","\"PREFRONTAL CORTEX\"","\"FIBROMYALGIA\"","\"NETWORK\"","\"REDUCTION\"","\"INTENSITY\""],"title":"Does conservative treatment change the brain in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain? : a systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeroen Kregel","Iris Coppieters","Robby De Pauw","Anneleen Malfliet","Lieven Danneels","Jo Nijs","Barbara Cagnie","Mira Meeus"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620929806,"objectID":"74e9aa4bc134c752f017686471e58ad8","permalink":"https://brave-chandrasekhar-719c31.netlify.app/publication/kregel-2017-does/","publishdate":"2021-10-17T21:50:09.415826Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kregel-2017-does/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Does conservative treatment change the brain in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain?: a systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robby De Pauw","Iris Coppieters","Mira Meeus","Karen Caeyenberghs","Lieven Danneels","Barbara Cagnie"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620929806,"objectID":"2465d64959a1629a4e06985492bb4dbe","permalink":"https://brave-chandrasekhar-719c31.netlify.app/publication/8506633/","publishdate":"2021-10-17T21:50:09.542324Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8506633/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Chronic neck pain affects 50% - 85% of people who have experienced an acute episode. This transition and the persistence of chronic complaints are believed to be mediated by brain alterations among different central mechanisms.  Objectives: This study aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the current existing evidence regarding structural and functional brain alterations in patients with whiplash associated disorders (WAD) and idiopathic neck pain (INP). Additionally, associations between brain alterations and clinical symptoms reported in neck pain patients were evaluated.  Study Design: Systematic review.  Methods: The present systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched. First, the obtained articles were screened based on title and abstract. Secondly, the screening was based on the full text. Risk of bias in included studies was investigated.  Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Alterations in brain morphology and function, including perfusion, neurotransmission, and blood oxygenation level dependent-signal, were demonstrated in chronic neck pain patients. There is some to moderate evidence for both structural and functional brain alterations in patients with chronic neck pain. In contrast, no evidence for structural brain alterations in acute neck pain patients was found.  Limitations: Only 12 articles were included, which allows only cautious conclusions to be drawn.  Conclusion: Brain alterations were observed in both patients with chronic WAD and chronic INP. Furthermore, more evidence exists for brain alterations in chronic WAD, and different underlying mechanisms might be present in both pathologies. In addition, pain and disability were correlated with the observed brain alterations. Accordingly, morphological and functional brain alterations should be further investigated in patients with chronic WAD and chronic INP with newer and more sensitive techniques, and associative clinical measurements seem indispensable in future research.","tags":["\"Traumatic neck pain\"","\"idiopathic non-traumatic neck pain\"","\"brain alterations\"","\"magnetic resonance imaging\"","\"single photon emission computed tomography\"","\"photon emission tomography\"","\"chronic neck pain\"","\"WHIPLASH-ASSOCIATED DISORDERS\"","\"2000-2010 TASK-FORCE\"","\"CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW\"","\"AGE-RELATED-CHANGES\"","\"WHITE-MATTER\"","\"SENSORIMOTOR DISTURBANCES\"","\"BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS\"","\"POSTURAL STABILITY\"","\"GENERAL-POPULATION\"","\"PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS\""],"title":"Is traumatic and non-traumatic neck pain associated with brain alterations? : a systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robby De Pauw","Iris Coppieters","Mira Meeus","Karen Caeyenberghs","Lieven Danneels","Barbara Cagnie"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620929806,"objectID":"e78497d2552b664c9d4df3fa878616c4","permalink":"https://brave-chandrasekhar-719c31.netlify.app/publication/de-2017-traumatic/","publishdate":"2021-10-17T21:50:09.800528Z","relpermalink":"/publication/de-2017-traumatic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Is traumatic and non-traumatic neck pain associated with brain alterations?: a systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.
